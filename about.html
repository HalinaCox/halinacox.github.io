        Halina Cox joined Meraki in 2018 as an Executive Assistant to the VP of
        Meraki Technical Support and Customer Success. During her time as an EA,
        she worked closely with a global team of Engineers, which sparked her
        interest in learning more about the field. After taking some time to
        independently learn more about computer programming, Halina was offered
        a position as a Software Engineer Apprentice, where she is currently
        working on fine tuning her software development skills.
