          <p>
            I'm a first-generation college graduate and professional, raised in a 
            hardworking immigrant family where resilience and discipline were part 
            of everyday life. I worked my way through college at UC Davis, never 
            imagining that my career would eventually lead me to where I am today.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            I began my career in event planning before transitioning into tech as 
            an Executive Assistant at Affirm, and later at Cisco Meraki. What 
            started as executive support quickly evolved into program management 
            and operations, where I partnered closely with global leaders across 
            technical support, customer success, and escalations teams to design
            onboarding programs, operating frameworks, and systems that helped the 
            organization scale with clarity and efficiency.
          </p>
          <br/>
          <p>
            While working at Meraki, a data-heavy project sparked my interest in 
            learning how to code. I realized that a deeper technical understanding 
            would allow me to design more efficient and scalable solutions, so I 
            began teaching myself programming fundamentals. That curiosity led to 
            an intensive bootcamp, followed by an apprenticeship where I gained 
            hands on experience, and eventually a full-time role as a Software 
            Engineer on Meraki’s award winning Dashboard API team.
          </p>

            Outside of my professional work, health and fitness have always been 
            a constant in my life. I’m a former certified personal trainer and 
            remain deeply invested in wellness, strength, and sustainable routines. 
            I’m currently spending time on a few early passion projects, including a 
            fitness app. I’m also a wife and mom to two young kids, and I love 
            exploring new places with my little family, trying new recipes, and finding
            balance between ambition and everyday life.
