          <p>
            This video demonstrates an integrations experience built for <strong>Cisco Meraki</strong> that connects multiple
            external systems into a unified workflow. The integrations enable real-time data exchange, status
            visibility, and configuration management across connected services, allowing users to easily understand
            which systems are connected, active, and functioning as expected.
          </p>
        <br>
          <p>
            I was responsible for building this end-to-end experience. On the front end, I implemented the responsive
            UI, created reusable components, built the integration cards, added dynamic states and icons, ensured
            accessibility, and aligned visual details such as colors, badges, and connected indicators with product
            and design specifications. I also made the cards interactive and ensured the layout adapted cleanly across
            screen sizes.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            On the back end, I implemented the supporting Rails logic to power the integrations, ensuring data
            was correctly surfaced, persisted, and reflected accurately in the UI. This included wiring up endpoints,
            handling integration state, and validating that the full workflow behaved reliably from both a user and
            system perspective.

            <strong>Shoe Therapy</strong> is a Ruby on Rails app for tracking shoe inventory and sale records.
            It highlights full-stack functionality including database integration, item listing, and cart behavior.
